# Population Graph, Hi!
## Description: 
I created this repository to save a code that is reading a csv file and it will show a graph with the data, allowing to write a country and show the population since 1970 to 2022, but this depends of the country
## Getting started
- Install python: Please check that you have python on your computer, you can download it from the next [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install the dependencies: Use pip to install the dependencies, you can use these commands: `pip install pandas` and `pip install matplotlib`
## Running the app
Please open a terminal in the directory of the project and use the command `py main.py`, after that and **important**, use the first option when you open the app, this command is going to create some files only if they are neccesary
## File logs
These are going to exist after you initialize the app, just like the next example: ![here](https://i.postimg.cc/tTbnJxXd/Upload.png)
